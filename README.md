# Lab 3 - Grove Slide Potentiometer Experiment 
## Introduction
The Grove Slide Potentiometer module incorporates a linear variable resistor with a maximum resistance of 10KΩ. When you move the slider from one side to the other, its output voltage will range from 0 V to the Vcc you apply. It connects to the other Grove modules through a standard 4-Pin Grove Cable. Three of the pins are connected to OUT (Pin 1), Vcc (Pin 3) and GND (Pin 4), while the fourth pin (Pin 2) is connected to an on-board green indicator LED. The LED is used to visually represent the resistance change on the potentiometer.

Replace the default code with the code in "main.cpp" from this GitHub repo by creating an empty project OR clone the GitHub code in to your Keil Studio Cloud IDE (recommended).
